# A simple library for doing graphics with Teensy

## Setup
Simply `git clone` this repository into your Arduino libraries folder (something like ~/Arduino/libraries) and use `#include <tgraphics.h>` for lower-level graphics functions or just `#include <animation_demos.h>` if you want to mess with the pre-made animations.
